# Welcome to my Personal Site!

This website was built using React, TypeScript and Tailwind.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Once you have those, you can clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/personal-site.git
cd personal-site
npm install

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the website locally by using the following command: 
  
npm start

This will start a development server and the website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Build

To build the production version of the website, run the following command:

npm run build
  
This will create a `build` folder with optimized production version of the website.

## Deployment

The website can be deployed to any web server or hosting service that supports serving a React app.

If you need help with deploying the site, you can check out the [React Deployment documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for more information.
